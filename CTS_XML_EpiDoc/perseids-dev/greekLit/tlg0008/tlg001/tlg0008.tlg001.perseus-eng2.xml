            <head>PREFACE</head>
            <p>THE author of the DEIPNOSOPHISTS was an Egyptian, born in Naucratis, a town on the
               left side of the Canopic Mouth of the Nile. The age in which he lived is somewhat
               uncertain, but his work, at least the latter portion of it, must have been written
               after the death of Ulpian the lawyer, which happened A. D. 228.</p>
            <p>Athenæus appears to have been imbued with a great love of learning, in the pursuit of
               which he indulged in the most extensive and multifarious reading; and the principal
               value of his work is, that by its copious quotations it preserves to us large
               fragments from the ancient poets, which would otherwise have perished. There are also
               one or two curious and interesting extracts in prose; such, for instance, as the
               account of the gigantic ship built by Ptolemæus Philopator, extracted from a lost
               work of Callixenus of Rhodes.</p>
            <p>The work commences, in imitation of Plato's Phædo, with a dialogue, in which Athenæus
               and Timocrates supply the place of Phædo and Echecrates. The former relates to his
               friend the conversation which passed at a banquet given at the house of Laurentius, a
               noble Roman, between some of the guests, the best known of whom are Galen and
               Ulpian.</p>
            <pb n="v.1.p.iv"/>
            <p>The first two books, and portions of the third, eleventh, and fifteenth, exist only
               in an Epitome, of which both the date and author are unknown. It soon, however,
               became more common than the original work, and eventually in a great degree
               superseded it. Indeed Bentley has proved that the only knowledge which, in the time
               of Eustathius, existed of Athenæus, was through its medium.</p>
            <p>Athenæus was also the author of a book entitled, <quote>On the Kings of
                  Syria,</quote> of which no portion has come down to us.</p>

               <p>ATHENAEUS is the author of this book; and in it he is discoursing with Timocrates:
                  and the name of the book is the Deipnosophists. In this work Laurentius is
                  introduced, a Roman, a man of distinguished fortune, giving a banquet in his own
                  house to men of the highest eminence for every kind of learning and
                  accomplishment; and there is no sort of gentlemanly knowledge which he does not
                  mention in the conversation which he attributes to them; for he has put down in
                  his book, fish, and their uses, and the meaning of their names; and he has
                  described divers kinds of vegetables, and animals of all sorts. He has introduced
                  also men who have written histories, and poets, and, in short, clever men of all
                  sorts; and he discusses musical instruments, and quotes ten thousand jokes: he
                  talks of the different kinds of drinking cups, and of the riches of kings, and the
                  size of ships, and numbers of other things which I cannot easily enumerate, and
                  the day would fail me if I endeavoured to go through them separately.</p>
               <p>And the arrangement of the conversation is an imitation of a sumptuous banquet;
                  and the plan of the book follows the arrangement of the conversation. This, then,
                  is the delicious feast of words which this admirable master of the <pb
                     n="v.1.p.2"/> feast, Athenæus, has prepared for us; and gradually sur- passing
                  himself, like the orator at Athens, as he warms with his subject, he bounds on
                  towards the end of the book in noble strides.</p>

               <p>And the Deipnosophists who were present at this banquet were, <hi rend="italics"
                     >Masyrius,</hi> an expounder of the law, and one who had been no superficial
                  student of every sort of learning; <hi rend="italics">Magnus</hi>. . . .
                  [Myrtilus] a poet, a man who in other branches of learning was inferior to no one,
                  and who had devoted himself in no careless manner to the whole circle of arts and
                  learning; for in everything which he discussed, he appeared as if that was the
                  sole thing which he had studied; so great and so various was his learning from his
                  childhood. And he was an iambic poet, inferior to no one who has ever lived since
                  the time of Archilochus. There were present also <hi rend="italics">Plutarchus,
                     and Leonidas</hi> of Elis, and <hi rend="italics">Aemilianus</hi> the
                  Mauritanian, and <hi rend="italics">Zöilus,</hi> all the most admirable of
                  grammarians.</p>
               <p>And of philosophers there were present <hi rend="italics">Pontianus</hi> and <hi
                     rend="italics">Democritus,</hi> both of Nicomedia; men superior to all their
                  contemporaries in the extent and variety of their learning; and <hi rend="italics"
                     >Philadelphus</hi> of Ptolemais, a man who had not only been bred up from his
                  infancy in philosophical speculation, but who was also a man of the highest
                  reputation in every part of his life. Of the Cynics, there was one whom he calls
                     <hi rend="italics">Cynulcus,</hi> who had not only two white dogs following
                  him, as they did Telemachus when he went to the assembly, but a more numerous pack
                  than even Actæon had. And of rhetoricians there was a whole troop, in no respect
                  inferior to the Cynics. And these last, as well, indeed, as every one else who
                  ever opened his mouth, were run down by <hi rend="italics">Uppianus</hi> the
                  Tyrian, who, on account of the everlasting questions which he keeps putting every
                  hour in the streets, and walks, and booksellers' shops, and baths, has got a name
                  by which he is better known than by his real one, <hi rend="italics"
                     >Ceitouceitus.</hi> This man had a rule of his own, to eat nothing without

                        >μέθυσος,</foreign> or drunk, applicable to a man? Can the word <foreign
                        xml:lang="grc">μήτρα,</foreign> or paunch, be applied to any eatable food? Is
                     the name <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύαγρος</foreign> a compound word applicable to

                  man of no slight insight into the principles of the Academic school; and <hi

                  philosophical and medical works as to surpass all those who preceded him, and who

                     >Alcides</hi> of Alexandria, was present. So that the whole party was so
                  numerous that the catalogue looks rather like a muster-roll of soldiers, than the
                  list of a dinner party.</p>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
               <p>Then after a little while he proceeds to the praises of Laurentius, and says that
                  he, being a man of a munificent spirit, and one who collected numbers of learned
                  men about him, feasted them not only with other things, but also with
                  conversation, at one time proposing questions deserving of investigation, and at
                  another asking for information himself; not suggesting subjects without
                  examination, or in any random manner, but as far as was possible with a critical
                  and Socratic discernment; so that every one marvelled at the systematic character
                  of his questions. And he says, too, that he was appointed superintendant of the
                  temples and sacrifices by that best of all sovereigns Marcus;<note
                     place="unspecified" anchored="true">Marcus Aurelius.</note> and that he was no
                  less conversant with the literature of the Greeks than with that of <pb
                     n="v.1.p.4"/> his own countrymen. And he calls him a sort of Asteropæus,<note
                     place="unspecified" anchored="true">Asteropæus was one of the Trojan heroes who
                     endeavoured to fight Achilles, being armed with two spears.</note> equally
                  acquainted with both languages. And he says that he was well versed in all the
                  religious ceremonies instituted by Romulus, who gave his name to the city, and by
                  Numa Pompilius; and that he is learned in all the laws of politics; and that he
                  has arrived at all this learning solely from the study of ancient decrees and
                  resolutions; and from the collection of the laws which (as Eupolis, the comic
                  writer, says of the poems of Pindar) are already reduced to silence by the
                  disinclination of the multitude for elegant learning. He had also, says he, such a
                  library of ancient Greek books, as to exceed in that respect all those who are
                  remarkable for such collections; such as Polycrates of Samos, and Pisistratus who
                  was tyrant of Athens, and Euclides who was himself also an Athenian, and
                  Nicorrates the Samian, and even the kings of Pergamos, and Euripides the poet, and
                  Aristotle the philosopher, and Nelius his librarian; from whom they say that our
                  countryman Ptolemæus, surnamed Philadelphus, bought them all, and transported them
                  with all those which he had collected at Athens and at Rhodes to his own beautiful
                  Alexandria. So that a man may fairly quote the verses of Antiphanes and apply them
                  to him:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>Of high philosophy.</l>
                  </quote> And as the Theban lyric poet<note place="unspecified" anchored="true"
                     >Pindar. Ol. i. 22.—See Moore's translation.</note> says:— <quote

                     <l>Full oft our tuneful band inspire.</l>
                  </quote> And when inviting people to his feasts, he causes Rome to be looked upon
                  as the common country of all of them. For who can regret what he has left in his
                  own country, while dwelling with a man who thus opens his house to all his
                  friends. For as Apollodorus the comic poet says:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  getting the first, and second, and fourth prizes, (for which victories Euripides
                  wrote a triumphal ode,) having sacrificed to Olympian Jupiter, feasted the whole

                  writing a triumphal ode for him. And Empedocles of Agrigentum, having gained the
                  victory in the horse race at the Olympic games, as he was himself a Pythagorean,
                  and as such one who abstained from meat, made an image of an ox of myrrh, and
                  frankincense, and the most expensive spices, and distributed it among all who came
                  to that festival. And Ion of Chios, having gained the tragic crown at Athens, gave

                  out the beginnings of many poems and other writings, recollected three or four

               <p>But Phanias says that Philoxenus of Cythera, a poet, being exceedingly fond of
                  eating, once when he was supping with Dionysius, and saw a large mullet put before
                  him and a small one before himself, took his up in his hands and put it to his
                  ear; and, when Dionysius asked him why he did so, Philoxenus said that he was
                  writing Galatea, and so he wished to ask the fish some of the news in the kingdom
                  of Nereus; and that the fish which he was asking said that he knew nothing about
                  it, as he had been caught young; but that the one which was set before Dionysius
                  was older, and was well acquainted with everything which he wished to know. On
                  which Dionysius laughed, and sent him the mullet which had been set before
                  himself. And Dionysius was very fond of drinking with Philoxenus, but when he
                  detected him in trying to seduce Galatea, whom he himself was in love with, he
                  threw him into the stone quarries; and while there he wrote the Cyclops,
                  constructing the fable with reference to what had happened to himself;
                  representing Dionysius as the Cyclops, and the flute-player as Galatea, and
                  himself as Ulysses.</p>

               <p>About the time of Tiberius there lived a man named Apicius; very rich and
                  luxurious; from whom several kinds of cheesecakes are called Apician. He spent
                  myriads of drachms on his belly, living chiefly at Minturnæ, a city of Campania,
                  eating very expensive crawfish, which are found in that place superior in size to
                  those of Smyrna, or even to the crabs of Alexandria. Hearing too that they were
                  very large in Africa, he sailed thither, without waiting a single day, and
                  suffered exceedingly on his voyage. But when he came near the place, before he
                  disembarked from the ship, (for his arrival made a great noise among the
                  Africans,) the fishermen came alongside in their boats and brought him some very
                  fine crawfish; and he, when he saw them, asked if they had any finer; and when
                  they said that there were none finer than those which they brought, he,
                  recollecting those at Minturnæ, ordered the master of the ship to sail back the
                  same way into Italy, without going near the land. But Aristoxenus, <pb

                  of his prodigious luxury used to syringe the lettuces which grew in his garden
                  with mead in the evening, and then, when he picked them in the morning, he would
                  say that he was eating green cheesecakes, which were sent up to him by the

               <p>When the emperor Trajan was in Parthia, at a distance of many days' journey from
                  the sea, Apicius sent him fresh oysters, which he had kept so by a clever

                  of Nicomedes, king of the Bithynians, made in imitation of the real fish, and set
                  before the king, when he expressed a wish for anchovies, (and he too at the time

               <p>Dioscorides, with respect to the laws praised in Homer, says, "The poet, seeing
                  that temperance was the most desirable virtue for young men, and also the first of
                  all virtues, and one which was becoming to every one; and that which, as it were,
                  was the guide to all other virtues, wishing to implant it from the very beginning
                  in every one, in order that men might devote their leisure to and expend their
                  energies on honourable pursuits, and might become inclined to do good to, and to
                  share their good things with others; appointed a simple and independent mode of
                  life to every one; considering that those desires and pleasures which had
                  reference to eating and drinking were those of the greater power, and of the
                  highest estimation, and moreover innate in all men; and that those men who
                  continued orderly and temperate in respect of them, would also be temperate and
                  well regulated in other matters. Accordingly, he laid down a simple mode of life
                  for every one, and enjoined the same system indifferently to kings and private
                  individuals, and young men and old, saying— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  at a marriage feast, or at any other sort of convivial meeting. And this, too,
                  though he often represents Agamemnon as feasting the chiefs. And Menelaus makes a
                  feast on the occasion of the marriage of his daughter Hermione; and again on the
                  occasion of the marriage of his son; and also when Telemachus comes to him— <quote

                     </l>
                  </quote> For Homer never puts rissoles, or forcemeat, or cheeseakes, or omelettes
                  before his princes, but meat such as was calculated to make them vigorous in body
                  and mind. And so too Agamemnon feasted Ajax after his single combat with Hector,
                  on a rumpsteak; and in the same way he gives Nestor, who was now of advanced age,
                  and Phœnix too, a roast sirloin of <pb n="v.1.p.14"/> beef. And Homer describes
                  Alcinous, who was a man of a very luxurious way of life, as having the same
                  dinner; wishing by these descriptions to turn us away from intemperate indulgence
                  of our appetites. And when Nestor, who was also a king and had many subjects,
                  sacrificed to Neptune on the sea-shore, on behalf of his own dearest and most
                  valued friends, it was beef that he offered him. For that is the holiest and most
                  acceptable sacrifice to the gods, which is offered to them by religious and
                  well-disposed men. And Alcinous, when feasting the luxurious Phæacians, and when
                  entertaining Ulysses, and displaying to him all the arrangements of his house and
                  garden, and showing him the general tenor of his life, gives him just the same
                  dinner. And in the same way the poet represents the suitors, though the most
                  insolent of men and wholly devoted to luxury, neither eating fish, nor game, nor
                  cheesecakes; but embracing as far as he could all culinary artifices, and all the
                  most stimulating food, as Menander calls it, and especially such as are called
                  amatory dishes, (as Chrysippus says in his Treatise on Honour and Pleasure,) the
                  preparation of which is something laborious.</p>

                  any one tasting lamb which had not been shorn, on an occasion when the breed of
                  sheep appeared to be failing. And Homer, though he speaks of the Hellespont as
                  abounding in fish, and though he represents the Phæacians as especially addicted
                  to navigation, and though he knew of many harbours in Ithaca, and many islands
                  close to it, in which there were large flocks of fishes and of wild birds; and
                  though he enumerates among the riches of the deep the fact of its producing fish,
                  still never once represents either fish or game as being put on the table to eat.
                  And in the same way he never represents fruit as set before any one, although
                  there was abundance of it; and although he is fond of speaking of it, and although
                  he speaks of it as being supplied without end. For he says, <quote>Pears upon
                     pears,</quote> and so on. Moreover, he does not represent his heroes as
                  crowned, or anointed, or using <pb n="v.1.p.15"/> perfumes; but he portrays even
                  his kings as scorning all such things, and devoting themselves to the maintenance
                  of freedom and independence.</p>
               <p>In the same way he allots to the gods a very simple way of life, and plain food,

                  materials of their feasts; making no mention of frankincens, or myrrh, or
                  garlands, or luxury of this sort. And he does not describe them as indulging in

                  he abhors satiety. <quote rend="blockquote">

                  all good for inflammations; and that, too, was Pramnian wine, which we know to be
                  very strong and nutritious. And he brings it to him too, not as a relief from
                  thirst, but to drink of abundantly; (at all events, when he has drank a good
                  draught of it, he recommends him to repeat it.) <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </quote> though in other places he does say that wine relaxes and enervates the
                  strength. And in the case of Hector, Hecuba, thinking that then he will remain in
                  the city all the rest of the day, invites him to drink and to pour libations,
                  encouraging him to abandon himself to pleasure. But he, as he is going out to
                  action, puts off the drinking. And she indeed, praises wine without ceasing; but
                  he, when he comes in out <pb n="v.1.p.16"/> of breath, will not have any. And she
                  urges him to pour a libation and then to drink, but he, as he is all covered with
                  blood, thinks it impiety.</p>
               <p>Homer knew also the use and advantages of wine, when he said that if a man drank
                  it in too large draughts it did harm. And he was acquainted, too, with many
                  different ways of mixing it. For else Achilles would not have bade his attendants
                  to mix it for him with more wine than usual, if there had not been some settled
                  proportion in which it was usually mixed. But perhaps he was not aware that wine
                  was very digestible without any admixture of solid food, which is a thing known to
                  the physicians by their art; and, therefore, in the case of people with heartburn
                  they mix something to eat with the wine, in order to retain its power. But Homer
                  gives Machaon meal and cheese with his wine; and represents Ulysses as connecting
                  the advantages to be derived from food and wine with one another when he says—

               <p>Homer, too, represents the virgins and women washing the strangers, knowing that
                  men who have been brought up in right principles will not give way to undue warmth
                  or violence; and accordingly the women are treated with proper respect. And this
                  was a custom of the ancients; and so too the daughters of Cocalus wash Minos on
                  his arrival in Sicily, as if it was a usual thing to do. On the other hand, the
                  poet, wishing to disparage drunkenness, represents the Cyclops, great as he was,
                  destroyed through inebriety by a man of small stature, and also Eurytian the
                  Centaur. And he relates how the men at Circe's court were transformed into lions

                  the Greeks also as drinking hard when sailing away from Troy, and on that account
                  quarrelling with one another, and in consequence perishing. And he relates that
                  Aeneas, the most eminent of the Trojans for wisdom , was led away by the manner in
                  which he had talked, and bragged, and made promises to the Trojans, while engaged
                  in drinking, so as to encounter the mighty Achilles, and was nearly killed. And
                  Agamemnon says somewhere about drunkennes— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>In Homer they eat sitting down; but some think that a separate table was set

                  for the feast. However, this is not very clearly proved, for Minerva may have
                  taken her food at Telemachus's table. But all along the banqueting-room full
                  tables were laid out, as is even now the custom among many nations of the
                  barbarians, <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Laden with all dainty dishes,</l>

               <pb n="v.1.p.19"/>
               <p>The feast which he mentions as taking place in the palace of Menelaus is of a
                  peculiar character; for there he represents the guests as conversing during the
                  banquet and then they wash their hands and return to the board, ad proceed to
                  supper after having indulged their grief. But the line in the last book of the
                  Iliad, which is usually read, <quote rend="blockquote">

                     <l>He eat and drank still, while the table stood,</l>
                  </quote> or else there would be blame implied for what Achilles was doing at the
                  moment; for how could it be decent that a table should be laid before Achilles, as
                  before a party of revellers, down the whole length of a banqueting-room? Bread,
                  then, was placed on the table in baskets, and the rest of the meal consisted
                  wholly of roast meat. But Homer never speaks of broth, Antiphanes says, <quote

                  <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐΐσην</foreign> meant a good feast; for as food is a
                  necessary good to men, he says that he, by extension of the meaning of the word,
                  called it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐΐσην.</foreign> But men in the early times, as
                  they had not food in sufficient abundance, the moment any appeared, rushed on it
                  all at once, and tore it to pieces with violence, and even took it away from
                  others who had it; and this disorderly behaviour gave rise to bloodshed. A d it is
                  from this that very probably the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτασθαλία</foreign>
                  originated, because it was in <foreign xml:lang="grc">θάλιαι,</foreign> another name
                  for banquets, tat men first offended against one another. But when, by the bounty
                     <pb n="v.1.p.20"/> of Ceres, food became abundant, then they distributed an
                  equal portion to each individual, and so banquets became orderly entertainments.
                  Then came the invention of wine and of sweetmeats, which were also distributed
                  equally: and cups, too, were given to men to drink out of, and these cups all held
                  the same quantity. And as food was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαὶς,</foreign>
                  from <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαίεσθαι,</foreign> that is, from being divided, so he
                  who roasted the meat was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαιτρὸς,</foreign> because
                  it was he who gave each guest an equal portion. We must remark that the poet uses
                  the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαὶς</foreign> only of what is eaten by men, and
                  never applies it to beasts; so that it was out of ignorance of the force of this

               <p>Now Homer represents the men of his time as eating fish and birds: at all events,

                  their vessel; it is plain that they were fond of and skilful in catching fish. And
                  again, the poet compares the companions of Ulysses, who were seized by Sylla, to
                  fish caught with a long rod and thrown out of doors; and he speaks more accurately
                  concerning this act than those who have written poems or treatises professedly on
                  the subject. I refer to Cæcilius of Argos, and Numenius of Heraclea, and Pancrates
                  the Arcadian, and Posidonius the Corinthian, and Oppianus the Cilician, who lived
                  a short time ago; for we <pb n="v.1.p.21"/> know of all those men as writers of
                  heroic poems about fishing. And of prose essayists on the subject we have Seleucus
                  of Tarsus, and Leonidas of Byzantium, and Agathocles of Atracia. But he never
                  expressly mentions such food at his banquets, just as he also forbears to speak f
                  the meat of young animals, as such food was hardly considered suitable to the
                  dignity of heroes of reputation. However, they did eat not only fish, but oysters;
                  though this sort of food is neither very wholesome nor very nice, but the oysters
                  lie at the bottom of the sea, and one cannot get at them by any other means,
                  except by diving to the bottom. <quote rend="blockquote">

                  cultivating a disposition like that of philosophers. And accordingly Agamemnon
                  leaves his bard as a guardian and counsellor to Clytæmnestra: who, first of all,
                  going through all the virtues of women, endeavoured to inspire her with an
                  ambition of excelling in virtuous and ladylike habits; and, after that, by
                  supplying her with agreeable occupation, sought to prevent her inclinations from
                  going astray after evil thoughts: so that Aegisthus could not seduce the woman
                  till he had murdered the bard on a desert island. And the same is the character of
                  that bard who sings under compulsion before the suitors; who bitterly reproached
                  them for laying plots against Penelope. We find too that using one general <pb

                  inconsistent with their own manners, for the purpose of pointing out to them the
                  evil of then, and persuading them to avoid such conduct. And Phemius sings to the

               <p>The dances spoken of in Homer are partly those of tumblers and partly those of
                  ball-players; the invention of which last kind Agallis, the Corcyrean authoress,
                  who wrote on grammar, attributes to Nausicaa, paying a compliment to her own
                  countrywoman; but Dicæarchus attributes it to the Sicyonians. But Hippasus gives
                  the credit of both this and gymnastic exercises to the Lacedæmonians. However,
                  Nausicaa is the only one of his heroines whom Homer introduces playing at ball.
                  Demoteles, the brother of Theognis the Chiansophist, was eminent for his skill in
                  this game; and a man of the name of Chærephanes, who once kept following a
                  debauched young man, and did not speak to him, but prevented him from misbehaving.
                  And when he said, <quote>Chærephanes, you may make your own terms with me, if you

                  have been a kind of small ball, was invented by Atticus the Neapolitan, the tutor

                  motion of those who played, or else because its inventor, as Juba the Mauritanian

                  of dance is an imitation of actions which are explained by words, and is what the
                  elegant Xenophon represents as having taken place, in his Anabasis, at the banquet
                  given by Seuthes the Thracian. He says:</p>
               <p>"After libations were made, and the guests had sung a pæan, there rose up first
                  the Thracians, and danced in arms to the music of a flute, and jumped up very
                  high, with light jumps, and used their swords. And at last one of them strikes
                  another, so that it seemed to every one that the man was wounded. And he fell down
                  in a very clever manner, and all the bystanders raised an outcry. And he who
                  struck him having stripped him of his arms, went out singing Sitalces. And others
                  of the Thracians carried out his antagonist as if he were dead; but in reality, he
                  was not hurt. After this some Aenianians and Magnesians rose up, who danced the
                  dance called Carpæa, they too being in armour. And the fashion of that dance was
                  like this: One man, having laid aside his arms, is sowing, and driving a yoke of
                  oxen, constantly looking round as if he were afraid. Then three comes up a robber;
                  but the sower, as soon as he sees him snatches up his arms and fights in defence
                  of his team in regular time to the music of the flute. And at last the robber,
                  having <pb n="v.1.p.26"/> bound the man, carries off the team; but sometimes the
                  sower conquers the robber, and then binding him alongside his oxen, he ties his
                  hands behind him, and drives him forward. And one man," says he, <quote>danced the
                     Persian dance, and rattling one shield against another, fell down, and rose up
                     again: and he did all this in time to the music of a flute. And the Arcadians
                     rising up, all moved in time, being clothed in armour, the flute-players
                     playing the tune suited to an armed march; and they sung the pæan, and
                     danced.</quote>

                  similar in its appointments and splendour, saying that he was ambitious of

               <p>In Homer, too, the suitors amused themselves in front of the doors of the palace
                  with dice; not having learnt how to play at dice from Diodorus of Megalopolis, or
                  from Theodorus, or from Leon of Mitylene, who was descended from Athenian
                  ancestors: and was absolutely invincible at dice, as Phanias says. But Apion of
                  Alexandria says that he had heard from Cteson of Ithaca what sort of game the game
                  of dice, as played by the suitors, was. For the suitors being a hundred and eight
                  in number, arranged their pieces opposite to one another in equal numbers, they
                  themselves also being divided into two equal parties, so that there were on each
                  side fifty-four; and between the men there was a small space left empty. And in
                  this middle space they placed one man, which they called Penelope. And they made
                  this the mark, to see if any one of them could hit it with his man; and then, when
                  they had cast lots, he who drew the lot aimed at it. Then if any one hit it and
                  drove Penelope forward out of her place, then he put down his own man in the place
                  of that which had been hit and moved from its place. After which, standing up
                  again, he shot his other man at Penelope in the place in which she was the second
                  time. And if he hit her again without touching any one of the other men, he won
                  the game, and had great hopes that he should be the man to marry her. He says too
                  that Eurymachus gained the greatest number of victories in this game, and was very
                  sanguine about his marriage. And in consequence of their luxury the suitors had
                  such tender hands that they were not able to bend the bow; and even their servants
                  were a very luxurious set.</p>

               <p>And his heroes sit at their banquets, and do not lie down. And this was sometimes
                  the case at the feasts of Alexander the king, as Dures says. For he once, when
                  giving a feast to his captains to the number of six thousand, made them sit upon
                  silver chairs and couches, having covered them with purple covers. And Hegesander
                  says that it was not the custom in Macedonia for any one to lie down at a banquet,
                  unless he had slain a boar which had escaped beyond the line of nets; but with
                  that exception, every one sat at supper. And so Cassander, when he was thirty-five
                  years of age, supped with his father in a sitting posture, not being able to
                  perform the above-mentioned exploit, though he was of man's estate, and a gallant
                  hunter.</p>
               <p>But Homer, who has always an eye to propriety, has not introduced his heroes
                  feasting on anything except meat, and that too they dressed for themselves. For it
                  caused neither ridicule nor shame to see them preparing and cooking their own
                  food: for they studied to be able to wait upon themselves; and they prided
                  themselves, says Chrysippus, on their dexterity in such matters. And accordingly
                  Ulysses boasts of being a better hand than any one else at making a fire and
                  cutting up meat. And in the book of the Iliad called The Prayers,<note

                  cupbearer, and Achilles prepares the supper. And when Menelaus celebrates a
                  marriage feast, Megapenthes the bridegroom acts as cupbearer. But now we have come
                  to such a pitch of effeminacy as to lie down while at our meals.</p>

                  stuff the sofas and chairs with sponge, as on the idea that that will make the
                  occupiers more amorous. And Theophrastus says that some contrivances are of
                  wondrous efficacy in such matters; and Phylarchus confirms him, by reference to
                  some of the presents which Sandrocottus, the king of the Indians, sent to
                  Seleucus; which were to act like charms in producing a wonderful degree of
                  affection, while some, on the contrary, were to banish love. Music, too, has been
                  cultivated now, in a way which is a great perversion of its legitimate use: and

                  trace of such a custom. For the life described in the Odyssey is that of men
                  living easily and luxuriously owing to the peace; on which account the men <pb
                     n="v.1.p.31"/> of that time indulged their bodies with baths and washings. And
                  that is the reason why in that state of things they play at dice, and dance, and
                  play ball. But Herodotus is mistaken when he says that those sports were invented
                  in he time of Atys to amuse the people during the famine. For the heroic times are
                  older than Atys. And the men living in the time of the Iliad are almost constantly
                  crying out— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>Now to go back to what we were saying before. The Athenians made Aristonicus the
                  Carystian, who used to play at ball with Alexander the king, a freeman of their
                  city on account of his skill, and they erected a statue to him. And even in later
                  times the Greeks considered all handicraft trades of much less importance than
                  inventions which had any reference to amusement. And the people of Histiæa, and of
                  Oreum, erected in their theatre a brazen statue holding a die in its hand to
                  Theodorus the juggler. And on the same principle the Milesians erected one to
                  Archelaus the harp- player. But at Thebes there is no statue to Pindar, though
                  there is one to Cleon the singer, on which there is the inscription— <quote

                     <l>Sweet singer, though on earth his race is run,</l>
                     <l>E'en the high heavens with his name resound.</l>
                  </quote> Polemo relates that when Alexander razed Thebes to the ground, one man
                  who escaped hid some gold in the garments of this statue, as they were hollow; and
                  then when the city was restored he returned and recovered his money after a lapse
                  of thirty years. But Herodotus, the logomime as he was called, and Archelaus the
                  dancer, according! to Hegesander, were more honoured by Antiochus the king than
                  any others of his friends. And Antiochus his father made the sons of Sostratus the
                  flute-player his body guards.</p>

                  puppet-master the use of the very stage on which Euripides had exhibited his noble
                  dramas. And they also erected a statue of Euripides in the theatre next to the
                  statue of Aeschylus. Xenophon the conjuror, too, was very popular among them, who
                  left behind him a pupil of the name of Cratisthenes, a citizen of Phlias; a man
                  who used to make fire spout up of its own accord, and who contrived many other
                  extraordinary sights, so as almost to make men discredit the evidence of their own
                  senses. And Nymphodorus the conjuror was another such; a man who having quarrelled
                  with the people of Rhegium, as Duris relates, was the first man who turned them
                  into ridicule as cowards. And Eudicus the buffoon gained great credit by imitating
                  wrestlers and boxers, as Aristoxenus relates. Straton of Tarentum, also, had many
                  admirers; he was a mimic of the dithyrambic poets; and so had Aenonas the Italian,
                  who mimicked the harp-players; and who gave representations of the Cyclops trying
                  to sing, and of Ulysses when shipwrecked, speaking in a clownish fashion. And
                  Diopeithes the Locrian, according to the account of Phanodemus, when he came to
                  Thebes, fastened round his waist bladders full of wine and milk, and then,
                  squeezing them, pretended that he was drawing up those liquids out of his mouth.
                  And Noëmon gained a great reputation for the same sort of tricks.</p>
               <p>There were also in Alexander's court the following jugglers, who had all a great
                  name. Scymnus of Tarentum, and Philistides of Syracuse, and Heraclitus of
                  Mitylene. And there were too some strolling players of high repute, such as
                  Cephisodorus and Pantaleon. And Xenophon makes mention also of Philip the
                  buffoon.</p>

               <p>Now of tragic dancing, as it was called, such as it existed in his time, Bathyllus
                  of Alexandria was the first introducer; whom Seleucus describes as having been a
                  legitimate dancer. This Bathyllus, according to the account of Aristonicus, and
                  Pylades too, who has written a treatise on dancing, composed the Italian dance
                  from the comic one which was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόρδαξ,</foreign> and
                  from the tragic dance which was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμμέλεια,</foreign>
                  and from the Satyric dance which was called <foreign xml:lang="grc"
                     >σίκιννις,</foreign> (from which also the Satyrs were called <foreign

                  named Sicinnus, though some say that Sicinnus was a Cretan. Now, the dance
                  invented by Pylades was stately, pathetic, and laborious; but that of Bathyllus
                  was in a merrier style; for he added to his a kind of ode to Apollo. But
                  Sophocles, in addition to being eminent for personal beauty, was very accomplished
                  in music and dancing, having been instructed in those arts while a boy by Lamprus,
                  and after the naval victory of Salamis, he having no clothes on, but only being
                  anointed with oil, danced round the trophy erected on that occasion to the music
                  of the lyre, but some say that he had his tunic on; and when he exhibited his
                  Thamyris he himself played the harp; and he also played at <pb n="v.1.p.34"/>
                  ball with great skill when he exhibited his Nausicaa. And Socrates the Wise was
                  very fond of the dance Memphis; and as he was often caught dancing, as Xenophon
                  relates, he said to his friends that dancing was a gymnastic exercise for every
                  limb; for the ancients used the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρχέομαι</foreign> for
                  every sort of motion and agitation. Anacreon says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>But Aeschylus was not only the inventor of becoming and dignified dress, which the
                  hierophants and torch-bearers of the sacred festivals imitated; but he also
                  invented many figures in dancing, and taught them to the dancers of the chorus.
                  And Chamæleon states that he first arranged the choruses; not using the ordinary
                  dancing-masters, but himself arranging the figures of the dancers for the chorus;
                  and altogether that he took the whole arrangement of his tragedies on himself. And
                  he himself acted in his own plays very fairly. And accord- ingly, Aristophanes
                  (and we may well trust the comic writers in what they say of the tragedians)
                  represents Aeschylus himself as saying— <quote rend="blockquote">

                     when the men came on who were uniting with Priam in his petition for the ransom

                  Telesis, or Telestes, (whichever was his right name,) the dancing-master, invented
                  many figures, and taught men to use the action of their hands, so as to give
                  expression to what they said. Phillis the Delian, a musician, says, that the
                  ancient harp-players moved their countenances but little, but their feet very
                  much, imitating the march of troops or the dancing of a chorus. Accordingly
                  Aristotle says, that Telestes the director of Aeschylus's choruses was so great a
                  master of his art, that in managing the choruses of the Seven Generals against
                  Thebes, he made all the transactions plain by dancing. They say, too, that the old
                  poets, Thespis, Pratinas, Carcinus, and Phrynichus, were called dancing poets,
                  because they not only made their dramas depend upon the dancing of the chorus, but
                  because, besides directing the exhibition of their own plays, they also taught
                  dancing to all who wished to learn. But Aeschylus was often drunk when he wrote
                  his tragedies, if we may trust Chamæleon: and accordingly Sophocles reproached
                  him, saying, that even when he did what was right he did not know that he was ding
                  so.</p>

                  the Athenians to honour Bacchus the physician. But Alcæus, the Mitylenæan poet,
                  says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  Antiphanes says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  Thus the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">βρέχω,</foreign> to moisten or soak, is often

                  games. But Homer passed over the use of vegetables, and fish, and birds, lest to
                  mention them should seem like praising gluttony, thinking besides there would be a
                  want of decorum in dwelling on the preparation of such things, which he considered
                  beneath the dignity of gods and heroes. But that they did in reality eat their
                  meat boiled as well as roasted, he shows when he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>But as a caldron boils with melting fat</l>
                     <l>Of well-fed pig;</l>
                  </quote>
                  <pb n="v.1.p.42"/> and the foot of the ox which was thrown at Ulysses proves it
                  too, for no one ever roasts oxen's feet. And the line too- <quote
                     rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Then many a well-fill'd dish was duly set</l>
                     <l>On the full board, with every kind of meat;</l>
                  </quote> as this not only speaks of the variety of meats, such as birds, pigs,
                  kids, and beef; but it also speaks of the way in which they were dressed as having
                  varied, and not having been all of one kind, but carefully arranged. So that you
                  may see here the origin of the Sicilian and Sybaritic and Italian ways of giving
                  feasts, and the Chian fashion also. For the Chians are reported not to have been
                  less studious than the other nations just mentioned in the art of dressing their
                  meat. Timocles says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The Chians</l>
                     <l>Are splendid hands at dressing viands.</l>
                  </quote> And in Homer, not only the young men, but the old men too, such as Phœnix
                  and Nestor, sleep with the women; and Menelaus is the only man who has no woman
                  allotted to him, inasmuch as he had collected the whole expedition for the sake of
                  his wife, who had been carried away from him.</p>

                  Though in reality old wine is not only more pleasant, but also better for health;
                  for it aids digestion more; and being thinner it is itself more digestible; it
                  also invigorates the body; and makes the blood red and fluid, and produces
                  untroubled sleep. But Homer praises that wine most which will admit of a copious
                  admixture of water; as the Maronean. And old wine will allow of more water being
                  added to it, because its very age has added heat to it. And some men say, that the
                  flight of Bacchus to the sea is emblematic of the making of wine, as it was
                  practised long ago; because wine is very <pb n="v.1.p.43"/> sweet when sea-water
                  is poured into it. And Homer praising dark-coloured wine, often calls it <foreign
                     xml:lang="grc">αἴθοψ.</foreign> For the dark-coloured wine is the strongest, and
                  it remains in the system of the drinkers of it longer than any other. But
                  Theopompus says, that black wine was first made among the Chians; and, that the
                  Chians were the first people who imparted the knowledge of planting and tending
                  vines to the rest of mankind, having learnt it from Œnopion the son of Bacchus,
                  who was the original colonizer of their island. But white wine is weak and thin;
                  but yellow wine is very digestible, being of a more drying nature.</p>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="48">
               <p>Respecting the Italian wines, Galen is represented by this sophist as saying, that
                  the Falernian wine is fit to drink from the time that it is ten or fifteen years
                  old, till it is twenty; but after that time it falls off, and is apt to give
                  headaches, and affects the nervous system. There are two kinds of Falernian wine,
                  the dry and the sweet. The sweet wine is made when the south wind blows through
                  the vineyard; which also makes it darker in colour. But that which is not made at
                  this time is dry and yellow. Of the Alban wine there are also two kinds, one sweet
                  and one sour; and both are in their prime after they are fifteen years old. The
                  wine of Surrentum begins to be drinkable when five-and-twenty years old; for as it
                  has no oil of any sort in it, and is very thin, it is a long time ripening: and
                  when it is old it is nearly the only wine that is wholesome to be drunk for a
                  continuance. But the Rhegian wine, being richer than the Surrentine, may be used
                  as soon as it is fifteen years old. The wine of Privernum too is very good, being
                  thinner than the Rhegian wine, and one which does not take much effect on the
                  head. And the Formian wine is like it; and is a wine which soon comes to its
                  prime; it is, however, a richer wine than the other, But the Trifoline wine is
                  slower ripening, and has a more earthy taste than the Surrentine. The Setine is a
                  wine of the first class, like the Falernian wine, but lighter, and not so apt to
                  make "a man drunk. The wine of Tibur is thin, and evaporates easily, being at its
                  best as soon as it is ten years old. Still it is better as it gets older. The
                  Labican wine is sweet and oily to the taste, being something between the Falerrian
                  and the Alban: and you may drink that when it is ten years old. There is the
                  Gauran wine too, a scarce and very fine wine, and <pb n="v.1.p.44"/> likewise
                  very powerful and oily; more so indeed than the wine of Præneste or of Tibur. The
                  Marsic is a very dry wine; and very good for the stomach. Around Cumæ in Campania
                  there is a wine made which is called Ulban, a light wine, fit to be drunk when
                  five years old. The wine of Ancona is a fine wine, and rather oily. The Buxentine
                  is like the Alban, as far as being rather sour; but it is a strong wine, and good
                  for the stomach. The Veliternian wine is very sweet to drink and good for the
                  stomach; but it has this peculiarity, that it does not taste like a pure wine, but
                  always has an appearance as if some other was mixed with it. The Calenian wine is
                  light, and better for the stomach than the Falernian. The Cæcuban is a noble wine,
                  full of strength and easily affecting the head; but it does not come to its prime
                  till after many years. The Fundan wine is strong, and nutritious, and affects the
                  head and stomach, on which account it is not much used at banquets. But the Sabine
                  wine is lighter than any of these, and is fit to be drunk from the time that it is
                  seven years old till it is fifteen; and the Signine wine is available at six years
                  old, but as it gets older it is far more valuable. The wine of Nomentum gets in
                  season very early, and can be drunk as soon as it is five years old; it is not
                  very sweet, and not very thin; but that of Spoletum is very sweet to the taste,
                  and has a golden colour. The wine of Capua is in many respects like the Surrentine
                  wine. The Barbine is very dry and continually improving. The Caucine too is a
                  noble wine, and resembles the Falernian. The wine of Venafrum is good for the
                  stomach, and light. The Trebellian wine, which is made round Naples, is of
                  moderate strength, good for the stomach, and pleasant to the taste. The Erbulian
                  wine is at first dark coloured, but in a few years it becomes white; and it is a
                  very light and delicate wine. That of Marseilles is a fine wine, but it is scarce,
                  and thick, with a good deal of body. The Tarentine, and all the other wines of
                  that district, are delicate wines, without very much strength or body, sweet, and
                  good for the stomach. The Mamertine is a foreign wine, made out of Italy. There is
                  also another wine made in Sicily, and called Iotaline; it is a sweet wine and
                  light, but there is some strength in it.</p>

                  But he, being made insolent and having his head turned by this liberality,
                  attempted to make himself tyrant of his country, and collected an army for that
                  purpose. On which the people of Cyzicus went out to battle against him, and

                  It is a peculiar kind of wine; and it is neither sweet nor thick, but dry and
                  hard, and of extraordinary strength; and Aristophanes says that the Athenians did
                  not like it, for that <quote>the Athenian people did not like hard and sour poets,
                     nor hard Pramnian wines, which contract the eyebrows and the stomach; but they
                     prefer a fragrant wine, ripe, and flavoured like nectar.</quote> For Semus says
                  that there is in Icarus a rock called the Pramnian rock; and near it is a great
                  mountain, from which the Pramnian wine has its name, and some call it a medicinal
                  wine. Now Icarus used formerly to be called the Fishy Icarus, from the number of
                  fish around it; just as the Echinades had their name from the sea-urchins, and the
                  promontory Sepias from the number of cuttle-fish which are taken near it. And in

                  vine, and by the people of Œnoe the Dionysiac vine. And Œnoe is a city in the

                  which is produced from the Five Hills, a place about seven furlongs from Sparta.
                  And he mentions another wine which comes from Denthiades, a small fortress, and
                  another from Œnus, and another from Onogle and Stathmi. And these places are all
                  near Pitane. Accordingly, he says, <quote>And wine from Œnus, or from Denthis, or
                     from Carystus, or from Onoglæ, or from Stathmi.</quote> The Carystian wine is
                  that which comes from Carystus in Laconia, on the borders of Arcadia. And he calls
                  it <quote>free from fire</quote> as not having been boiled; for they often used
                  boiled wines. Polybius says that there was an admirable wine made at Capua; which
                  was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναδενδρίτης,</foreign> to which no other wine
                  was at all comparable. But Alciphron of the Mæander says, that there was a
                  mountain village near the Ephesian territories, which was formerly called
                  Latona's, but is now called Latorea, from Latorea the Amazon; and that there also
                  Pramnian wine is made. Timachidas the Rhodian calls a wine made at Rhodes <foreign
                     xml:lang="grc">ὑπόχυτος,</foreign> or <hi rend="italics">the adulterated</hi>
                  <hi rend="italics">wine,</hi> being near akin to sweet wine. But that wine is
                  called <foreign xml:lang="grc">γλύξις</foreign> which goes through no process of
                  decoction.</p>
               <p>There is also a Rhodian wine, which Polyzelus calls <foreign xml:lang="grc"
                     >αὐτίτης·</foreign>

                  greatest perfection at Beneventum, a city in Italy. But the wine Amphis is spoken
                  of as a very poor wine by Sosicrates. The ancients used also a certain wine made
                  of spices, which they called <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίμμα.</foreign> But
                  Theophrastus, in his History of Plants, says, that a wine is made in Heræa in
                  Arcadia which, when it is drunk, drives men out of their senses, and makes women
                  inclined to preg- nancy: and that around Cerunia in Achaia there is a kind of
                  vine, from which a wine is made which has a tendency to cause abortion in pregnant
                  women; and if they eat the grapes too, says he, they miscarry;—and the Trœzenian
                  wine, he says, makes those who drink it barren: and at Thasos, <pb n="v.1.p.53"/>
                  says he, they make a wine which produces sleep, and another which causes those who
                  drink it to keep awake.</p>

                     which is given in the prytaneum, is wonderfully delicious; for it is well
                     seasoned; for they knead up dough with honey, and put that into the earthen
                     jars; so that the wine receives fragrance from itself, and sweetness from the
                     honey.</quote> And he proceeds to say, <quote>If any one mixes harsh wine which
                     has no smell with soft and fragrant wine, such, for instance, as the Heraclean
                     wine with that of Erythræ, softness is derived from the one, and wholesomeness
                     from the other.</quote> And the Myrtite or Myrrhine wine is spoken of by

               <p>Now of wines some are white, some yellow, and some red. The white is the thinnest
                  in its nature, diuretic, and warm; and being a promoter of digestion it causes a
                  heat in the head; for it is a wine which has a tendency to move upwards. But of
                  red wine that which is not sweet is very nutritious, and is astringent; but that
                  which is sweet (as is the case with even white and yellow wine also) is the most
                  nutrition of all: for it softens all the ducts and passages, and thickens the
                  fluid parts of the body, and does not at all confuse the head. For in reality the
                  nature of sweet wine lingers about the ribs, and engenders spittle, as Diodes and
                  Praxagoras asset. But Mnesitheus the Athenian says, <quote>Red wine is the mot
                     nutritious; but white is the most diuretic and the thinnest; and the <pb
                        n="v.1.p.54"/> yellow is a dry wine, and that which most assists in the
                     digestion of the food.</quote>
               </p>
               <p>Now the wines which have been very carefully prepared with sea-water never cause
                  headaches; and they open the bowels, and sometimes gripe the stomach, and produce
                  flatulency, and assist in the digestion of food. Of this character is the Myndian
                  wine, and that of Halicarnassus. And so Menippus the Cynic calls Myndus
                     <quote>brine-drinking.</quote> The Coan wine too has a good deal of sea-water
                  in it. The Rhodian has not so much sea-water; but a great deal of that wine is
                  good for nothing. Wine made in the islands is very good to drink, and not at all
                  ill-calculated for daily use. But Cnidian wine makes blood, is nutritious, and
                  keeps the bowels in a healthy state; though if it is drunk in great quantities it
                  relaxes the stomach. The Lesbian wine is less astringent, and more diuretic. But
                  the Chian is a nicer wine; and of all the Chian wine, that called the Aryusian is
                  the best. And of this there are three varieties: for there is a dry kind, and a
                  sweet kind; and that the flavour of which is between the two is called <hi
                     rend="italics">autocratic,</hi> that is, self-mixed. Now the dry kind is
                  pleasant to the taste, nutritious, and more diuretic than the others; but the
                  sweet kind is nutritious, filling, and apt to soften the bowels. The autocratic
                  wine in its effects also is something between the two. But, generally speaking,
                  the Chian wine is digestible, nutritious, a producer of good blood, mild, and
                  filling, inasmuch as it has a great deal of body. But the nicest of all wines are
                  the Alban and Falernian wines of Italy; but these, if they have been kept a length
                  of time and are old, acquire a medicinal effect, and rapidly produce a sensation
                  of heaviness. But the wine called Adrian relieves any oppression of the breath, is
                  very digestible, and wholly free from all unpleasant consequences; but these wines
                  require to be made with rapidity, and then to be set in an open place, so as to
                  allow the thicker portions of their body to evaporate. But the best wine to keep a
                  length of time is the Corcyrean. The Zacynthian and Leucadian wines also are apt
                  to be bad for the head, because they contain chalk. There is a wine from Cilicia,
                  called Abates, which has no effect except that of relaxing the bowels. But hard
                  water, such as that from springs, or from rain if it is filtered, and has stood
                  some time, agrees very well with Coan and Myndian and Halicarnassian wine, <pb
                     n="v.1.p.55"/> and indeed with every wine which has plenty of salt-water in
                  it. And accordingly these wines are of the greatest use at Athens and Sicyon,
                  because the waters in these cities are harsh. But for those wines which have no
                  sea-water, and which are of a more astringent nature, especially for the Chian and
                  Lesbian wine, the purest water is the most suitable. <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>The Mareotic wine, which comes from Alexandria, had its name from a fountain in
                  the district of Alexandria called Marea; and from a town of the same name which
                  was close to it; which was formerly a place of great importance, but is now
                  reduced to a petty village. And the fountain and town derived their name from
                  Maro, who was one of the companions of Bacchus in his expedition. And there are
                  many vines in that country, which produce grapes very good to eat when raw, and
                  the wine which is made from them is excellent. For it is white, and sweet, and
                  good for the breath, and digestible, and then, it never produces any ill effect on
                  the head, and is diuretic. And still better than this is the wine called Tæniqtic.
                  The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταινία</foreign> means a riband; and there is in
                  that district a long narrow riband of land, the wines produced from which are of a
                  slightly green colour, with something oily in them, which is quickly dissolved
                  when it is mixed with water; just as the Attic honey is dissolved by the same
                  process. This Tæniotic wine, in addition to being sweet, has something aromatic in
                  it, of a slightly astringent character. But there are vines near the Nile in great
                  quantities as far as the river extends; and there are many peculiarities in those
                  vines, both a to their colour and as to their use. However, the best of all the
                  wines made in that district is that made near the city of Antylla (which is not
                  far from Alexandria), the revenues fro which the kings of those ages, both the
                  Egyptian and Persian kings, used to give to their wives for pin-money. But the
                  wine which is made in the Thebais, especially that near the city Coptos, is light,
                  and easy of digestion, and also so great an assistant in <pb n="v.1.p.56"/> the
                  digestion of the rest of one's food, that it is given to people in fevers without
                  injury. <quote rend="blockquote">

            <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="61">
               <p>Theopompus the Chian says, that the vine is found at Olympia, near the Alpheus;
                  and that there is a place about eight furlongs from Elis where the natives at the
                  time of the Dionysian games close up three empty brazen vessels, and seal them in
                  the presence of all the people round about; and at a subsequent time they open
                  them and find them full of wine. But Hellanicus says, that the vine was first
                  discovered in Plinthina, a city of Egypt; on which account Dion, the academic
                  philosopher, calls the Egyptians fond of wine and fond of drinking: and also, that
                  as subsidiary to wine, in the case of those who, on account of their poverty,
                  could not get wine, there was introduced a custom of drinking beer made of barley;
                  and moreover, that those who drank this beer were so pleased with it that they
                  sung and danced, and did everything like men drunk with wine. Now Aristotle says,
                  that men who are drunk with wine show it in their faces; but that those who have
                  drunk too much beer fall back and go to sleep; for wine is stimulating, but beer
                  has a tendency to stupefy.</p>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="62">
               <p>Now that the Egyptians really are fond of wine this is a proof, that they are the
                  only people among whom it is a custom at their feasts to eat boiled cabbages
                  before all the rest of their food; and even to this very time they do so. And many
                  people add cabbage seed to potions which they prepare as preventives against
                  drunkenness. And wherever a vineyard has cabbages growing in it, there the wine is
                  weaker. On which account the citizens of Sybaris also, as Timmeus says, used to
                  eat cabbages before drinking. And so Alexis says— <quote rend="blockquote">

               <p>THE conversation which you reported to me did not allow me to give up a
                  considerable portion of the day to sleep, as it was of a very varied nature.</p>
               <p>Nicander of Colophon says that wine, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶνος,</foreign> has
                  its name from Œneus:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Œneus pour'd the juice divine</l>
                     <l>In hollow cups, and called it wine.</l>
                  </quote> And Melanippides of Melos says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>'Twas Œneus, master, gave his name to wine.</l>
                  </quote> But Hecatæus of Miletus says, that the vine was discovered In Aetolia;
                  and adds, <quote>Orestheus, the son of Deucalion, came to Aetolia to endeavour to
                     obtain the kingdom; and while he was there, a bitch which he had brought forth
                     a stalk: and he ordered it to be buried in the ground, and from it <pb
                        n="v.1.p.58"/> there sprang up a vine loaded with grapes. On which account
                     he called his son Phytius. And he had a son named Œneus, who was so called from
                     the vines: for the ancient Greeks,</quote> says he, <quote>called vines
                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶναι.</foreign> Now Œneus was the father of
                     Aetolus.</quote> But Plato in his Cratylus, inquiring into the etymology of the
                  word <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶνος,</foreign> says, that it is equivalent to
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰόνους,</foreign> as filling the mind, <foreign
                     xml:lang="grc">νοῦς,</foreign>, with <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἴησις,</foreign> or
                  self-conceit. Perhaps, however, the word may be derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc"
                     >ὄνησις,</foreign> succour. For Homer, giving as it were the derivation of the
                  word, speaks nearly after this fashion— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>And then you will be succour'd (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀνήσεαι</foreign>) if

               <p>Timæus of Tauromenium relates that there was a certain house at Agrigentum called
                  the Trireme, on this account:— Some young men got drunk in it, and got so mad when
                  excited by the wine, as to think that they were sailing in a trireme, and that
                  they were being tossed about on the sea m a violent storm; and so completely did
                  they lose their senses, that they threw all the furniture, and all the sofas and
                  chairs and beds, out of window, as if they were throwing them into the sea,
                  fancying that the captain had ordered them to lighten the ship because of the
                  storm. And though a crowd collected round the house and began to plunder what was
                  thrown out, even that did not cure the young men of their frenzy. And the next
                  day, when the prætors came to the house, there were the young men still lying,
                  sea-sick as they said; and, when the magistrates questioned them, they replied
                  that they had been in great danger from a storm, and had consequently been
                  compelled to lighten the ship by throwing all their superfluous cargo into the
                  sea. Arid while the magistrates marvelled at the bewilderment of the men, one of
                  them, who seemed to be older than the rest, said, <quote>I, O Tritons, was so
                     frightened that I threw myself down under the benches, and lay there as low
                     down and as much out of sight as I could.</quote> And the magistrates forgave
                  their folly, and dismissed them with a reproof, and a warning not to indulge in
                  too much wine in future. And they, professing to be much obliged to them, said,
                     <quote>If we arrive in port after having escaped this terrible storm, we will
                     erect in our own country statues of you as our saviours in a conspicuous place,

               <p>And Philochorus relates that Amphictyon, the king of the Athenians, having learnt
                  of Bacchus the art of mixing wine, <pb n="v.1.p.63"/> was the first man who ever
                  did mix it: and that it is owing to him that men who have been drinking on his
                  system can walk straight afterwards, when before they used to blunder about after
                  drinking sheer wine: and on this account he erected an altar to the Straight
                  Bacchus in the temple of the Seasons; for they are the Nymphs who cherish the
                  fruit or the vine. And near it he built also an altar to the Nymphs, as a memorial
                  to all who use mixed drink; for the Nymphs are said to have been the nurses of
                  Bacchus. And he made a law to bring an unmixed wine after meals only just enough
                  to taste, as a token of the power of the Good Deity. But the rest of the wined was
                  put on the table ready mixed, in whatever quantity any one chose. And then he
                  enjoined the guests to invoke in addition the name of Jupiter the Saviour, for the
                  sake of instructing and reminding the drinkers that by drinking in that fashion
                  they would be preserved from injury. But Plato, in his second book of the Laws,
                  says that the use of wine is to be encouraged for the sake of health. But on
                  account of the look which habitual drunkards get, they liken Bacchus to a bull;
                  and to a leopard, because he excites drunkards to acts of violence. And Alcæus
                  says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Wine sometimes than honey sweeter,</l>
                     <l>Sometimes more than nettles bitter.</l>
                  </quote> Some men, too, are apt to get in a rage when drunk; and they are like a
                  bull. Euripides says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Fierce bulls, their passion with their horns displaying.</l>
                  </quote> And some men, from their quarrelsome disposition when drunk, are like

                  made of it, and though Pindar, the most grandiloquent of poets, has said that
                     <quote>water is the best of all things.</quote> And Homer, too, the most divine
                  of all poets, recognised it as a most nutritious thing, when he spoke of a grove
                  of poplars nourished by the water. He also praises its transparent nature— <quote

                     </l>
                  </quote> and the water which is of a lighter nature, and of greater value, he
                  calls <quote>lovely:</quote> at all events he calls the Titaresius lovely which
                  falls into the Peneus. And he mentions also some water as especially good for
                  washing; and Praxagoras of Cos, following his example, speaks of a water as
                  beauteous— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Beauteous it flows, to wash all dirt away.</l>
                  </quote> And he distinguishes also between sweet water and brackish (<foreign
                     xml:lang="grc">πλατὺς</foreign>) water; though when he calls the Hellespont
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλατὺς,</foreign> he uses the word in the sense of broad.
                  But with respect to sweet water, he says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Near the sweet waters then our ships we stay'd.<note place="unspecified"

               <p>He was acquainted too with the effect which warm water has on wounds: at all
                  events he describes Eurypylus's wounds as being washed with it; and yet, if the
                  object was to stop the hemorrhage, cold water would have been useful, since that
                  contracts and closes up wounds; but with the view of relieving the pain, he bathes
                  these with warm water, which has a soothing effect. And in Homer the word <foreign
                     xml:lang="grc">λιαρὸς</foreign> is used for what we call <foreign xml:lang="grc"
                     >θερμὸς,</foreign>
                  <hi rend="italics">warm.</hi> And he shows that plainly enough in what he says
                  about the fountains of the Scamander, saying— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  being quite useless; and he prefers to all others the waters of springs, and those
                  which rise to the surface from a great depth, and through rich soil. As also
                  Hesiod says— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>A ceaseless spring of clear untroubled flow.</l>

                     <l>Which from Tilphossa's lovely fountains flows;</l>
                  </quote> (Tilphossa is a fountain in Bœotia;) and Aristophanes says that Tiresias
                  died from drinking of it, as at his advanced age he was unable to bear its extreme
                  cold. And Theophrastus, in his book on Waters, says that the water of the Nile is
                  the most productive and the sweetest of all waters, and that it is also very
                  relaxing to the bowels of those who drink it, as it has in it a mixture of nitre.
                  And again, in his book on Plants, he says that there is in some places water which
                  has a procreative tendency; as for instance at Thespiæ: and at Pyrrha there is a
                  water which causes barrenness. But it happened once when there was a drought in
                  the district around the Nile, that the water of that river became unwholesome, and
                  many of the Egyptians died. Theophrastus states, moreover, that not only do bitter
                  waters sometimes change their nature, but that salt water does so too, and
                  sometimes whole rivers do so; as in the case of the fountain in Cithæron, near
                  which there is a temple of Jupiter; and of that in Cairo, near which there is a
                  temple of Neptune: and the reason is, that many thunderbolts fall in those
                  countries.</p>

               <p>But there are some waters which have a good deal of body in them, and are of
                  considerable weight; as that in Trœzen,—for that gives the mouths of those who
                  taste it a feeling of fulness. And the waters near the mines in Pangæum, in
                  winter, weigh ninety-six drachms to half a pint, but in summer they only weigh
                  forty-six. For the cold contracts and condenses it; on which account that which is
                  used in hour- <pb n="v.1.p.69"/> glasses does not make the hours in winter the
                  same as those in summer, but longer; for the flow is slower on account of the
                  increased density of the water. And he sys that the same is the case in Egypt,
                  though the air there is softer. Brackish water is more earthy, and requires more
                  working; as also does sea-water, the nature of which is warmer, and which is not
                  exposed to the same changes as river-water And there is one salt spring which is
                  of invincible hardness,—I mean that of Arethusa. But as a general rule heavy
                  waters are worse, and so are hard and cold waters, for the same reason; for they
                  are not so easily prepared for use, some because they are very earthy, and some
                  from the excess of cold. But those waters which are quickly warmed are light and
                  wholesome. And in Crannon there is a spring of a gentle warmth, which keeps wine
                  which is mixed with it of the same temperature for two or three days. But flowing
                  waters, and waters from aqueducts, are, as a general rule, better than stagnant
                  ones, being softer because of the collisions to which they are subjected; and on
                  this account water derived from snow appears to be good, because its more
                  drinkable qualities are brought to the surface, and are exposed to the influence
                  of the air; and for the same reason they think it better than rain-water: and on
                  the same ground, too, they prefer water from ice, because it is lighter; and the
                  proof is, that ice is itself lighter than the rest of the water. But very cold
                  water is hard, as being earthy; but that with much body in it, when it is warmed,
                  is susceptible of greater heat, and when it is cold, descends to a more intense
                  cold. And for the same reason water on the mountains is better to drink than water
                  in the plains; for there is in such less admixture of earthy matter. And it is
                  from the earthy particles present that waters vary in colour: at all events, the
                  water of the lake at Babylon is red for some days after it is drawn; and that of
                  the Borysthenes is for some time of a violet or dark colour, although it is
                  unusually thin in quality; and a proof of this is, that at the point where it
                  meets the Hypanis its waters flow above those of the latter while the north winds
                  prevail.</p>

               <p>And in many places there are fountains, some of which are good for drinking, and
                  have a vinous flavour; as for instance, one in Paphlagonia, which they say the
                  natives come to for the express purpose of drinking. Some, again, are salt, with
                     <pb n="v.1.p.70"/> a rather bitter flavour; as some among the Sicani in
                  Sicily. And in the Carthaginian dominions there is a fountain on which there is
                  something which floats resembling oil, but darker in colour, which they skim off
                  and make into balls, and use for their sheep and cattle; and in other districts,
                  too, there are fountains of a greasy nature,—like the one in Asia concerning which
                  Alexander wrote a letter, saying that he had found a fountain of oil. And of
                  waters which are warm by nature some are sweet, as that at Aegee in Cilicia, and
                  that at Pagasæ, and that at Larissa in the Troas, and that near Magnesia, and that
                  in Melos, and that in Lipara, and that in Prusa,—the Prusa, I mean, near Mount
                  Olympus in Mysia,—which is called the Royal fountain. But that in Asia near
                  Tralles, and those near the river Characometes, and near the city of Mysia, are so
                  oily that those who bathe in them have no need of oil. And there is a similar
                  fountain in the village of Dascylum. There is also one at Carura of an exceeding
                  dryness and heat: and there is another near Menoscome, which is a village in
                  Phrygia, of a rougher and a more nitrous quality; as there is too in a village in
                  Phrygia, called The Lion's Village. And there is a spring near Dorylæum, which is
                  very delicious to drink; but those which are at Baiæ or Baium, a harbour in Italy,
                  are utterly undrinkable.</p>

                  that four days' journey further on it becomes bitter, because some bitter spring
                  falls into it. And Theopompus says that near the river Erigone all the water is

                  Achillean, the stream of which is very sweet, while the sediment is brackish: this
                  is the water in which the Milesians say that their hero bathed when he had slain
                  Trambelus the king of the Leleges. And they say, too, that the water in Cappadocia
                  never becomes putrid, but there is a great deal in that district, of an admirable
                  quality, though it has no outlet unless it flows underground. And Ptolemy the
                  king, in the Seventh Book of his Commentaries, says that as you go to Corinth
                  through the district called Contoporia, when you have got to the top of the
                  mountain there is a fountain whose waters are colder than snow, so that many
                  people are afraid to drink of it lest they should be frozen; but he says that he
                  drank of it himself. And Phylarchus states that at Cleitor there is a spring which
                  gives those who drink of it a distaste for the smell of wine. And Clearchus tells
                  us that water is called white, like milk; and that wine is called red, like
                  nectar; and that honey and oil are called yellow, and that the juice which is
                  extracted from the myrtle-berry is black. Eubulus says that "water makes those who

               <p>Phylarchus says that Theodorus the Larisssean was a water-drinker; the man, I
                  mean, who was always so hostile to king Antigonus. He asserts also that all the
                  Spaniards drink water, though they are the richest of all men, for they have the
                  greatest abundance of gold and silver in their country. And he says, too, that
                  they eat only once a day, out of stinginess, though they wear most expensive
                  clothes. And Aristotle or Theophrastus speaks of a man named Philinus as never
                  having taken any drink or solid food whatever, except milk alone, during the whole
                  of his life. And Pythermus, in his account of the tyrants of Piræus, mentions
                  Glaucon as having been a water-drinker. And Hegesander the Delphian says that
                  Anchimolus and Moschus, sophists who lived in Elis, were water-drinkers all their
                  lives; and that they ate nothing but figs, and for all that, were quite as healthy
                  and vigorous as any one else; but that their perspiration had such an offensive
                  smell, that every one avoided them at the baths. And Matris the Athenian, as long
                  as he lived, ate nothing except a few myrtle-berries each day, and abstained from
                  wine and every other kind of drink except water. Lamprus, too, the musician, was a
                  water-drinker, concerning whom Phrynichus says, <quote>that the gulls lamented,
                     when Lamprus died among them, being a man who was a water-drinker, a subtle
                     hypersophist, a dry skeleton of the Muses, an ague to nightingales, a hymn to
                     hell.</quote> And Machon the comic poet mentions Moschion as a
                  water-drinker.</p>

                  of salt meat have yet not had their thirst stimulated by it; of whom Archonides
                  the Argive was one. And Mago the Carthaginian passed three times through the
                  African desert eating dry meal and never drinking And Polemo the Academic
                  philosopher, from the <pb n="v.1.p.73"/> time that he was thirty years of age to
                  the day of his death, never drank anything but water, as is related by Antigonus
                  the Carystian. And Demetrius the Scepsian says that Diocles of Peparethus drank
                  cold water to the day of his death. And Demosthenes the orator, who may well be
                  admitted as a witness in his own case, says that he drank nothing but water for a
                  considerable length of time. And Pyheas says, <quote>But you see the demagogues of
                     the present day, Demosthenes and Demades, how very differently they live. For
                     the one is a water-drinker, and devotes his nights to contempla- tion, as they
                     say; and the other is a debauchee, and is drunk every day, and comes like a
                     great potbellied fellow, as he is, into our assemblies.</quote> And Euphorion
                  the Chalcidean writes in this way:—"Lasyrtas the Lasionian never required drink as
                  other men do, and still it did not make him different from other men. And many
                  men, out of curiosity, were careful to watch him, but they desisted before they
                  ascertained what was the truth. For they continued watching him for thirty days
                  together in the summer season, and they saw that he never abstained from salt
                  meat, and yet that, though drinking nothing, he seemed to have no complaint in his
                  bladder. And so they believed that he spoke the truth. And he did, indeed,
                  sometimes take drink, but still he did not require it.</p>

               <p>The king of Persia, as Herodotus relates in his first book, drank no water, except
                  what came from the river Choaspes, which flows by Susa. And when he was on a
                  journey, he had numbers of four-wheeled waggons drawn by mules following him,
                  laden with silver vessels containing this water, which was boiled to make it keep.
                  And Ctesias the Cnidian explains also in what manner this water was boiled, and
                  how it was put into the vessels and bought to the king, saying that it was the
                  lightest and sweetest of all waters. And the second king of Egypt, he who was
                  surnamed Philadelphus, having given his daughter Berenice in marriage to Antiochus
                  the king of Syria, took the trouble to send her water from the river Nile, in
                  order that his child might drink of no other river, as Polybius relates. And <pb
                     n="v.1.p.74"/> Heliodorus tells us, that Antiochus Epiphanes, whom Polybius
                  calls Epimanes,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">

                  fountain at Antioch with wine; a thing which Theopompus relates to have been also
                  done by the Phrygian Midas, when he wished to make Silenus drunk in order to catch
                  him. And that fountain is, as Bion relates, between the Mædi and the Pæonians, and
                  is called Inna. But Staphylus says, that Melampus was the first who invented the
                  idea of mixing wine with water. And Plistonicus says that water is more digestible
                  than wine.</p>

               <p>Now men who drink hard before eating, are usually not very comfortable in their
                  digestion, which are apt to get out of order by such a system, and what they eat
                  often turns sour on the stomach. So that a man who has a regard for his health,
                  ought to take regular exercise, for the sake of promoting frequent perspiration;
                  and he ought also to use the bath regularly for the sake of moistening and
                  relaxing his body. And besides this, and before he bathes, he should drink water,
                  as being an excellent thing,—drinking warm water usually in winter and spring, and
                  cold water in summer, in order not to weaken the stomach. But he should only drink
                  in moderation before the bath or the gymnasium, for the sake of diffusing what he
                  drinks throughout his system beforehand, and in order to prevent the unmixed
                  strength of wine from having too much effect on his extremities. And if any one
                  thinks it too much trouble to live on this system, let him take sweet wine, either
                  mixed with water or warmed, especially that which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc"
                     >πρότροπος,</foreign> the sweet Lesbian wine, as being very good for the
                  stomach.</p>
               <p>Now sweet wines do not make the head heavy, as Hippocrates says in his book on
                  Diet, which some entitle, <quote>The Book on Sharp Pains;</quote> others,
                     <quote>The Book on Barley-water;</quote> and others, <quote>The Book against
                     the Cnidian Theories.</quote> His words are: <quote>Sweet wine is less
                     calculated to make the head heavy, and it takes less hold of the mind, and
                     passes through the bowels easier than other wine.</quote> But Posidonius says,
                  that it is not a good thing to pledge one's friends as the Carmani do; for they,
                  when at their banquets they wish to testify their friendship for each other, cut
                  the veins on their faces, and mingle the blood which flows down with the liquor,
                     <pb n="v.1.p.75"/> and then drink it; thinking it the very extremes proof of
                  friendship to taste one another's blood. And after pledging one another in this
                  manner, they anoint their heads with ointment, especially with that distilled from
                  roses, and if they cannot get that, with that distilled from apples, in order to
                  ward off the effects of the drink, and in order also to avoid being injured by the
                  evaporation of the wine; ad if they cannot get ointment of apples, they then use
                  that extracted from the iris or from spikenard, so that Alexis very neatly
                  says—</p>

               <p>But one ought to avoid thick perfumes, and to drink water which is thin and
                  transparent, and which in respect of weight is light, and which has no earthy
                  particles in it. And that water is best which is of a moderate heat or coldness,
                  and which, when poured into a brazen or silver vessel, does not produce a blackish
                  sediment. Hippocrates says, <quote>Water which is easily warmed or easily chilled
                     is always lighter.</quote> But that water is bad which takes a long time to
                  boil vegetables; and so too is water full of nitre, or brackish. And in his book
                  upon Waters, Hippocrates calls good water drinkable; but stagnant water he calls
                  bad, such as that from ponds or marshes. And most spring-water is rather hard. But
                  Erasistratus says that some people test water by weight, and that is a most stupid
                  proceeding. <quote>For just look,</quote> says he, <quote>if men compare the water
                     from the fountain Amphiaraus with that from the Eretrian spring, though one of
                     them is good and the other bad, there is absolutely no difference in their
                     respective weights.</quote> And Hippocrates, in his book on Places, says that
                  those waters are the best which flow from high ground, and from dry hills,
                     <quote>for they are white, and sweet, and are able to bear very little wine,
                     and are warm in winter and cold in summer.</quote> And he praises those most,
                  the springs of which break towards the east, and especially towards the
                  north-east, for they must inevitably be clear, and fragrant, and light. Diodes
                  says that water is good for the digestion, and not apt to cause flatulency, that
                  it is moderately cooling, and good for the eyes, and that it has no tendency to
                  make the head feel heavy, and that it adds vigour to the mind and body. And
                  Praxagoras <pb n="v.1.p.76"/> says the same; and he also praises rain-water. But
                  Euenor praises water from cisterns, and says that the best is that from the
                  cistern of Amphiaraus, when compared with that from the fountain in Eretria.</p>

               <p>But that water is undeniably nutritious is plain from the fact that some animals
                  are nourished by it alone, as for instance, grasshoppers. And there are many other
                  liquids which are nutritious, such as milk, barley-water, and wine. At all events,
                  animals at the breast are nourished by milk; and there are many nations who drink
                  nothing but milk. And it is said that Democritus, the philosopher of Abdera, after
                  he had determined to rid himself of life on account of his extreme old age, and
                  when he had begun to diminish his food day by day, when the day of the
                  Thesmophorian festival came round, and the women of his household besought him not
                  to die during the festival, in order that they might not be debarred from their
                  share in the festivities, was persuaded, and ordered a vessel full of honey to be
                  set near him: and in this way he lived many days with no other support than honey;
                  and then some days after, when the honey had been taken away, he died. But
                  Democritus had always been fond of honey; and he once answered a man, who asked
                  him how he could live in the enjoyment of the best health, that he might do so if
                  he constantly moistened his inward parts with honey, and his outward man with oil.
                  And bread and honey was the chief food of the Pythagoreans, according to the
                  statement of Aristoxenus, who says that those who eat this for breakfast were free
                  from disease all their lives. And Lycus says that the Cyrneans (and they are a
                  people who live near Sardinia) are very long-lived, because they are continually
                  eating honey; and it is produced in great quantities among them.</p>

               <p>The Persians, according to the account of Heraclides, are the people who first
                  introduced the system of having particular servants to prepare the couches, in
                  order that they might always be elegantly arranged and well made. And on this
                  account Artaxerxes, having a high esteem for Timagoras the Cretan, or, as Phanias
                  the Peripatetic says, for Entimus the Gortinian, who went up to the king in
                  rivalry of Themistocles, gave him a tent of extraordinary size and beauty, and a
                  couch with silver feet; and he sent him also expensive coverlets, and a man to
                  arrange them, saying that the Greeks did not know how to arrange a couch. And so
                  completely had this Cretan gained the favour of the king, that he was invited to a
                  banquet of the royal family, an honour which had never been paid to any Greek
                  before, and never has been since; for it was reserved as an especial compliment
                  for the king's relations. Nor was this compliment paid to Timagoras the Athenian,
                  who submitted to offer adoration t the king, and who was held in the highest
                  honour by him, though some of the things which were set before the kin were sent
                  to him from the royal table. The king of Persi, too, once took achaplet from off
                  his head and dipped it in perfume, and sent it to Antalcidas the Lacedæmonian. But
                  he did this too, and many similar things, to Entimus; also, and in addition to
                  everything else, he invited him to a banquet of the royal family. And the Persians
                  were very indignant this, <pb n="v.1.p.80"/> thinking that it was making such an
                  honour too common, and also because they thought they were on the eve of another
                  expedition against Greece. He sent him also a couch with silver feet, and cushions
                  for it, and a flowered tent surmounted with a canopy, and a silver chair, and a
                  gilt parasol, and some golden vessels inlaid with precious stones, and a hundred
                  large vessels of silver, and silver bowls, and a hundred girls, and a hundred
                  boys, and six thousand pieces of gold, besides what was allowed him for his daily

               <p>We find a fruit called Damascenes. Now many of the ancient writers mention

                     yellow, and strong: it has a smooth bark, like that of the medlar; and a single
                     root, which goes down very deep into the earth; the fruit is round, of the size
                     of an olive; when fully ripe it is of a yellow colour, becoming gradually
                     darker; and from its flavour and juice it might almost be taken for a wild
                     medlar.</quote> By which description of the cratægus it appears to me that he

               <p>With respect to Almonds.—The Naxian almonds are mentioned by the ancient writers;
                  and those in the island of Naxos are superior to all others, as I am well
                  persuaded. Phrynichus says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  comparison of those which come from other quarters, they are very long, and
                  slightly bent at the end. And Seleucus in his Dictionary says, that the
                  Lacedæmonians call soft nuts <foreign xml:lang="grc">μύκηροι.</foreign> And the
                  Servians give that name to sweet nuts. But Arnexias says that it is the almond
                  which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">μύκηρος.</foreign> We may add, there is
                  nothing which is a greater provocative of drinking than almonds when eaten before
                  meals. Eupolis says in his Taxiarchs— <quote rend="blockquote">

                  detected in always eating five or six bitter almonds before he drank. But when he
                  was prevented from eating them he was not able to stand even a very limited
                  quantity of wine; and the cause of this was the great power of the bitterness of
                  the almond, which is of a very drying nature, and which has the quality of
                  expelling moisture.</p>
               <p>Herodian of Alexandria says, that almonds derive the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc"

                  food, and produce flatulence, and also cause what has been eaten to turn on the
                  stomach, because it is followed by what is by nature unmanageable and
                  indigestible; and it is from such food that indigestions and attacks of diarrhœa
                  arise.</p>

               <p>Diodes asserts that almonds are nutritious and good for the stomach, and that they
                  have a heating effect because they contain something like millet; but green
                  almonds are less likely to have an injurious effect than dry ones; and almonds
                  soaked in water have such an effect less than those which are not soaked; and when
                  toasted less than when raw. But walnuts, which are also called nuts of Heraclea,
                  and acorns of Jupiter, are not indeed so nutritious as almonds, but still they
                  have something like millet in them, and something apt to rise to the surface; so,
                  if they are eaten in ay quantity they make the head feel heavy; they, however, are
                  less likely to produce injurious effects when green than when dry.</p>
               <p>Persian nuts too are as apt to produce headches as the acorns of Jupiter; but they
                  are more nutritious, though they make the throat and mouth feel rough; but when
                  they are roasted they are less injurious, and when eaten with honey, they are the
                  most digestible of all nuts The broad Persian nuts <pb n="v.1.p.88"/> have the
                  greatest tendency to produce flatulence; but when boiled they are less injurious
                  than when raw, or even when roasted. But Philotimus in his treatises on
                  Nourishment says, <quote>The broad nut, and that which is called the Sardinian
                     nut, are both exceedingly indigestible when raw, and are very slow in
                     dissolving in the stomach, as they are kept down by the phlegm in the stomach,
                     and as they themselves are of an astringent nature. The Pontic nut too is oily
                     and indigestible; but the almond is not so indigestible as that, and
                     accordingly if we eat a number of them we do not feel any inconvenience; and
                     they appear more oily, and give out a sweet and oily juice.</quote>
               </p>
               <p>Diphilus of Siphnos says—<quote>There is a nut called the Royal nut, which causes
                     severe headaches, and keeps rising in the stomach; and there are two sorts of
                     them, one of which, that which is tender and white, is the more juicy and the
                     better; but that which is roasted in ovens is not nutritious. Almonds have a
                     tendency to make people thin, and are diuretic and cathartic, and far from
                     nutritious; and the dry ones are far more apt to produce flatulence and are far
                     more indigestible than the green ones, which do not give much juice, and which
                     are not very nutritious; but those which are tender, and full, and white, being
                     like milk, are more full of wholesome juice. And the Thasian and Cyprian nuts,
                     being tender, are far more easily digested than dry ones. The nuts of Pontus
                     are apt to produce headaches, but still they are not so indigestible as the
                     Royal nuts.</quote>

               <p>Moreover, Mnesitheus the Athenian, in his book on Comestibles, says, <quote>The
                     digestion of Eubœan nuts or chestnuts (for they are called by both names) is
                     very difficult for the stomach, and is attended with a great deal of
                     flatulence. And they are apt to thicken the juice, and to make people fat,
                     unless their constitution is strong enough to neutralise them. But almonds, and
                     likewise the nuts of Heraclea, and the Persian nuts, and all others of the same
                     sort, are still worse than these: and it is desirable to touch absolutely none
                     whatever of these things unless they are first cooked by fire; with the
                     exception of, perhaps, the green almonds. But one should boil some of them, and
                     roast others; for some of them are of an oily nature, as the dry almonds and
                     the acorns of Jupiter; but some are hard and harsh, as the nuts of the <pb

                     of the fire extracts the oil, which is the worst part of them: but those which
                     are hard and harsh are softened, and, so to say, ripened, if any one cooks them
                     over a small and gentle fire.</quote>

                  nutritious, and full of excellent juice; but not very easy of digestion, because
                  they remain a long time in the stomach; that, however, when they are roasted they
                  are less nutritious, but more digestible; and that when boiled they are less apt
                  to produce flatulence than the others, and more nutritious. <quote

                  the only kinds of green vegetable which do not produce animal life, because of
                  their harshness and bitterness. But the vetch, says he, turns black as it decays.
                  He says, also, that caterpillars come in vetches, and it is in the fourth book of
                  the same treatise that he states this. Diphilus the Siphnian writer says that
                  lupins are very apt to create moisture, and are very nutritious, especially those
                  kinds Which are rendered sweet by being soaked. On which account Zeno the Citiæan,
                  a man of harsh disposition and very apt to get in a passion with his friends, when
                  he had taken a good deal of wine, became sweet-tempered and gentle; and when
                  people asked him what produced this difference in his disposition, he said, that
                  he was subject to the same influences as lupins: for that they before they were
                  cooked were very bitter; but that when they had been steeped in liquor they were

               <p>With respect to Radishes.—The Greek name <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥαφανὶς</foreign>

                  clearly refer to the radishes, and not to the cuttle-fish; as is shown by

                  those the leaves of which are smooth, are the sweetest. But Callias used the form

                  is plainly sown by Aristophanes, who in the Danaïdes alludes to such old forms,

                  the best lettuce at Smyrna and Galatea, and the best rue at Myra. Diphilus says,
                  "The gourd is far from nutritious, easily digested, apt to produce moisture in the
                  skin, promotes the secretions of the body, and is full of agreeable and wholesome
                  juice; but it is still more juicy when cooked. Its alterative qualities are
                  increased when it is eaten with mustard, but it is more digestible, and it
                  promotes the secretions more, when boiled.</p>
               <p>Mnesitheus too says, "All the vegetables and fruits which are easily affected by
                  the action of fire, such as the cucumber, and the gourd, and the quince, and the
                  small quince, and everything else of the same sort, when they are eaten after
                  having been roasted, afford nutriment to the body, in no great quantity indeed,
                  but still such as is pleasant and promotes moisture. However all these vegetables
                  and fruits have a tendency to produce constipation, and they ought to be eaten
                  boiled rather than raw. But the Attic writers call the gourd by no other name but

                  bowels, and are very nutritious, but still that they are not very digestible, and
                  that they are apt to produce flatulence. And that especially those from the island
                  of Ceos have this character. "Many are even poisonous to a fatal degree. But those
                  which seem to be wholesome are those with the smoothest rinds, which are tender
                  and easily crushed: such as grow close to elms and pine-trees. But those which are
                  unwholesome are of a dark colour, or livid, or covered with hard coats; and those
                  too which get hard after being boiled and placed on the table; for such are deadly
                  to eat. But the best remedy for them when eaten unawares is drinking honey-water,
                  and fresh mead, and vinegar. And after such a drink the patient should vomit. On
                  which account, too, it is especially desirable to dress mushrooms with vinegar, or
                  honey and vinegar, or honey, or salt: for by these means their choking properties
                  are taken away. But Theophrastus, in his treatise about Plants, writes thus—
                     <quote>But plants of this kind grow both under the ground and on the ground,
                     like those things which some people call fungi, which grow in company with
                     mushrooms; for they too grow without having any roots; but the real mushrooms
                     have, as the beginning by which they adhere to the ground, a stalk of some
                     length, and they put forth fibres from that stalk.</quote> He <pb

                  cules, when there is a high tide, mushrooms grow on the shore close to high-water
                  mark, which they say are left there by the sun. And Phænias says, in his first

                  and production of these things which seed beneath the earth; as, for instance, of
                  the truffle, and of a plant which grows around Cyrene, which they call <hi

                     >itum,</hi> which grows in Thrace. And a peculiarity is mentioned as incidental
                  to these things; for men say that they appear when there is heavy rain in autumn
                  and violent thunder; especially when there is thunder, as that is a more
                  stimulating cause of them: however, they do not last more than a year, as they are
                  only annuals; they are in the greatest perfection in the spring, when they are
                  most plentiful. Not but what there are people who believe that they are or can be
                  raised from seed. At all events, they say that they never appeared on the shore of
                  the Mitylenæans, until after a heavy shower some seed was brought from Tiaræ; and
                  that is the place where they are in the greatest numbers. But they are principally
                  found on the sea-shore, and wherever the ground is sandy; and that is the
                  character of the place called Tiaræ. They are also found near Lampsacus, and also
                  in Acarnania, and Alopeconnesus, and in the district of the Eleans. Lynceus the
                  Samian says—<quote>The sea produces nettles, and the land produces
                     truffles;</quote> and Matron, the man who wrote parodies, says in his

                  <pb n="v.1.p.103"/> Diphilus says that truffles are by nature indigestible, but
                  that they are full of wholesome juice, and have lenitive qualities, and are very
                  easily evacuated; though, like mushrooms, some of them are apt to produce
                  suffocation. And Hegesander the Delphian says that no truffles are found in the
                  Hellespont, and no fish of the kind called <foreign xml:lang="grc"
                     >γλαυκίσκος,</foreign> and no thyme. On which account Nausiclides said of the
                  country, that it had no spring and no friends. But Pamphils says, in his

                  asparagus and marsh asparagus; the best kinds of which are not raised from seed;
                  but they are remedies for every kind of internal disorder. But those which are
                  raised from seed grow to an immense size. And they say that in Libya, among the

                  that on the mountain land and on land near the sea they grow to the thickness of

                  diuretic, and injurious to the kidneys and bladder. But it is the Athenians who
                  give it the name of bursting; and they also give the flowering cabbage, or

               <p>Swine's brains, too, was a not uncommon dish. Philosophers used to forbid our
                  eating these, saying that a person who partook of them might as well eat a bear,
                  and would not stick at eating his father's head, or anything else imaginable. And
                  they said, that at all events none of the ancients had ever eaten them, because
                  they were the seat of nearly all sensation. But Apollodorus the Athenian says,

                  a plant called the dog-brier, something between a brier and a tree, according to
                  the statement of Theophrastus, and it has a red fruit, like a pomegranate, and it
                  has a leaf like that of the willow.</p>

               <p>Phænias, in the fifth book of his treatise on Plants, speaks of one which he calls
                  the Sicilian cactus a very prickly plant. As also does Theophrastus, in his sixth
                  book about Plants, who says, <quote>But the plant which is called the cactus
                     exists only in Sicily, and is not found in Greece: and it sends forth stalks
                     close to the ground, just above the root. And the stalks are the things which
                     are called cacti: and they are eatable as soon as they are peeled, and rather
                     bitter; and they preserve them in brine. But there is a second kind, which
                     sends up a straight stalk, which they call <foreign xml:lang="grc"
                        >πτέρνιξ</foreign>; and that also is eatable. The shell of the fruit, as
                     soon as the outer soft parts have been taken away, is like the inside of a
                     date: that also is eatable; and the name of that is <foreign xml:lang="grc"
                        >ἀσκάληρον.</foreign>
                  </quote> But who is there who would not place such belief in these assertions as
                  to say confidently that this cactus is the same as that plant which is called by
                  the Romans <hi rend="italics">carduus,</hi> or thistle; as the Romans are at no
                  great distance from Sicily, and as it is evidently the same plant which the Greeks
                  call <foreign xml:lang="grc">κινάρα,</foreign> or the artichoke? For if you merely
                  change two letters, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάρδος</foreign> and <foreign
                     xml:lang="grc">κάκτος</foreign> will be the same word.</p>
               <p>And Epicharmus also shows us plainly this, when he puts down the cactus in his
                  catalogue of eatable vegetables; in this way—<quote>The poppy, fennel, and the
                     rough cactus; now one can eat of the other vegetables when dressed with milk,
                     if he bruises them and serves them up with rich sauce, but by themselves they
                     are not worth much.</quote> And in a subsequent passage he
                     says—<quote>Lettuces, pines, squills, radishes, cacti.</quote> And again he
                     says—<quote>A man came from the country, bringing fennel, and cacti, and

                  <hi rend="italics">About the Ascent of the Nile.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Thales the Milesian, one of the seven wise that the overflowing of the Nile arises
                  from the Etestian for that they blow up the river, and that the mouths of the
                  river lie exactly opposite to the point from which they blow; and accordingly that
                  the wind blowing in the opposite direc- tion hinders the flow of the waters; and
                  the waves of the sea, dashing against the mouth of the river, and coming on with a
                  fair wind in the same direction, beat back the river, and in this manner the Nile
                  becomes full to overflowing. But Anaxagoras the natural philosopher says that the
                  fullness of the Nile arises from the snow melting; and so, too, says <pb
                     n="v.1.p.120"/> Euripides, and some others of the tragic poets. And Anaxagoras
                  says that this is the sole origin of all that fulness; but Euripides goes further,
                  and describes the exact place where this melting of the snow takes place; for in
                  his play called <quote>Archelaus</quote> he speaks thus:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Danaus, the noble sire of fifty daughters,</l>
                     <l>Leaving the Nile, the fairest stream on earth,</l>
                     <l>Fill'd by the summer of the Aethiop land,</l>
                     <l>The negro's home, when the deep snow does melt,</l>
                     <l>And o'er the land the Sun his chariot drives.</l>
                  </quote> And in the <quote>Helen</quote> he says something similar:— <quote
                     rend="blockquote">
                     <l>These are the beauticous virgin streams of Nile,</l>

                     <l>Of Egypt when the white snow melts on th' hills.</l>
                  </quote> And Aeschylus says—</p>

               <p>And Callisthenes the historian argues against what I quoted just now as stated by
                  Anaxagoras and Euripides: and he, too, declares his own opinion,—that as there is
                  much very heavy and continued rain in Aethiopia about the time of the rising of
                  the Dogstar, and from that period till the rising of Arcturus, and as the Etesian
                  winds blow at about the same time, (for these are the winds which he says have the
                  greatest tendency to bring the clouds over Aethiopia,) when the clouds fall upon
                  the mountains in that region, a vast quantity of water bursts forth, in
                  consequence of which the Nile rises. But Democritus says that about the winter
                  solstice there are heavy falls of snow in the countries around the north; but that
                  when the sun changes its course, at the summer solstice, the snow being melted and
                  evaporated by the warmth, clouds are formed, and then the Etesian gales catch hold
                  of them, and drive them towards the south; and when these clouds are all driven
                  together towards Aethiopia and Libya, a mighty rain ensues, and the water from
                  that flows down the mountains and fills the Nile. This, then, is the cause which
                  Democritus alleges for this fulness of the Nile.</p>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="90">
               <p>But Euthymenes the Massiliote says, speaking of his <pb n="v.1.p.121"/> own
                  knowledge, acquired in a voyage which he had made, that the sea outside the
                  Pillars of Hercules flows towards Libya and turns up and proceeds towards the
                  north; and that then, being driven back by the Etesian gales, it is raised to a
                  height by the winds, and flows high at that time; but, when the Etesian gales
                  cease, it recedes. He says moreover, that that sea is sweet to the taste, and that
                  it contains monsters like the crocodiles and the hippopotami in the Nile.</p>
               <p>But Œnopides the Chian says, that in winter the sources of the river are dried up,
                  but in the summer they are thawed and flow; and so that for the sake of filling up
                  the previous dryness, the rains from heaven cooperate with * * * * * * * * And on
                  this account the river is smaller in winter and is full in summer.</p>
               <p>But Herodotus gives an explanation quite contrary to that of the rest of those who
                  have discussed this subject, but agreeing with the explanation of Œnopides; for he
                  says that the stream of the Nile is of such magnitude as always to fill the river;
                  but that the sun, as it makes its journey through Libya in the winter, dries up
                  the river at that time; but that as it has gone off towards the north at the time
                  of the sum- mer solstice, then the river becomes full again, and overflows the
                  plains.</p>
               <p>Now these are the mouths of the Nile:—towards Arabia, the Pelusiac mouth; towards
                  Libya, the Canopic: and the rest are,—the Bolbitic, the Sebennytic, the Mendesian,
                  the Saitic, and the Opuntic.</p>
